"""
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we 
have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
 how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t
 matter. For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four 
 solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.
